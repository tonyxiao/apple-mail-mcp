"""outputSchema freeze at v0.11 (docs/v1-contract.md §8) — two artifacts:

1. **The derived freeze** (snapshots/output_schemas.json): each tool's
   success shape is derived FROM ITS RETURN TYPE (envelope.schema_of), so
   every variant a tool can return is frozen by construction. Rows that
   read "dict" are dynamic passthroughs (doctor's checks, triage_apply's
   result, fts health) whose shape no type can see into.

2. **The oracle proof** (snapshots/oracle_output_schemas.json): the
   shipped v0.11 build's fixture-observed wire snapshot, copied verbatim —
   the implementation-independent acceptance surface. The comparator below
   proves the derived shapes agree with the oracle wherever both are
   mechanically comparable; every incomparable node is named in
   EXPECTED_SKIPS and asserted, never silently passed.
